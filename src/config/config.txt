  This `config.json` file stores environment-specific settings for your application. Each environment 
 (`development`, `test`, `production`) has its own configuration:

 - **`queryCacheTimeMs`**: Specifies how long data should be cached in milliseconds
  (e.g., 60 seconds for development, 30 seconds for testing, 120 seconds for production).

 - **`refreshQueriesOnWindowFocus`**: Determines whether data should refetch when the app window regains focus 
 (`true` for development/production, `false` for testing).

 This file ensures that environment-specific behavior is centralized, making the app easier to configure and maintain across different stages of the development lifecycle."
